## Working
### Install and Working                                                                                                                                        
System must have updated version of node and npm                                                                                                                     
First Create your Mongo DB cluster and Open AI account ( for API keys to use AI ) and Cloudinary ( to save images in cloud ) and add you crendials in .env file

Open Two Terminals                                                                                                                                                 In the first terminal :                                                                                                                                            
cd client                                                                                                                                                       
npm install                                                                                                                                                       
npm run dev                                                                                                                                                      
This would start the frontend


In the second terminal :                                                                                                                                           cd sever                                                                                                                                                        
npm install                                                                                                                                                       
npm start                                                                                                                                                        
This would start the backend
